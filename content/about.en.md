## I'm...

Yusei Nishiyama, a programmer and music enthusiast.

I majored in philosophy and aesthetics but the beauty of programming languages led me to become a programmer and I've now been working with iOS since 2012.

When I'm not coding, I'm spending some time listening to and making music. You can find me playing jazz piano in a pub.
