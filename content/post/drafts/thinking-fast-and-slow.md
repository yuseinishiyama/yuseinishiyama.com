Daniel Kahnemanの"Thinking, Fast and Slow"を読んだ。とても長い本で、様々な人間の認知バイアスを紹介した本として総括されることが多い。だが、認知バイアス自体は少し懸命な人なら薄々自覚しているだろうし、それほど目新しいものでもない。大事なのは、様々な認知バイアスが分類され名前がつけられることであり、実際に

Ultimately, a richer language is essential to the skill of constructive criticism. Much like medicine, the identification of judgment errors is a diagnostic task, which requires a precise vocabulary. The name of a disease is a hook to which all that is known about the disease is attached, including vulnerabilities, environmental factors, symptoms, prognosis, and care. Similarly, labels such as “anchoring effects,” “narrow framing,” or “excessive coherence” bring together in memory everything we know about a bias, its causes, its effects, and what can be done about it.

確かに、前半はそのような内容なのだが、そうしたバイアスが生み出すより大きなレベルでの難問が提示される後半部こそがこの本の醍醐味ではないかと思われる。その難問とは、組織的な意思決定、公平性、幸せである。

最後の数章にかけてもっと壮大な問題提議がなされている。特にほぼ終盤の37章

## 公平性

altruistic punishment is accompanied by increased activity in the “pleasure centers” of the brain. It appears that maintaining the social order and the rules of fairness in this fashion is its own reward.

Kahneman, Daniel. Thinking, Fast and Slow (p. 308). Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Kindle Edition.

“This reform will not pass. Those who stand to lose will fight harder than those who stand to gain.”

Kahneman, Daniel. Thinking, Fast and Slow (p. 309). Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Kindle Edition.

We consider it morally desirable for base rates to be treated as statistical facts about the group rather than as presumptive facts about individuals. In other words, we reject causal base rates.

Kahneman, Daniel. Thinking, Fast and Slow (p. 169). Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Kindle Edition.

Because adherence to standard operating procedures is difficult to second-guess, decision makers who expect to have their decisions scrutinized with hindsight are driven to bureaucratic solutions—and to an extreme reluctance to take risks.

## 幸せ

Closely following daily fluctuations is a losing proposition, because the pain of the frequent small losses exceeds the pleasure of the equally frequent small gains.

Kahneman, Daniel. Thinking, Fast and Slow (p. 339). Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Kindle Edition.

What we learn from the past is to maximize the qualities of our future memories, not necessarily of our future experience.

我々は日常的に幸福についてカジュアルに言及する。どんな主義主張も究極的には誰かの幸せのためであり、そうでなければ支持を集めることはない。人権や環境の議論もそうだ。今どこかにいる、もしくは、未来の人間の幸福のために様々な主張を戦わせているわけである。だが、カーネマンはその主観的な幸福感がいかに脆い指標であるかということを指摘する。

まず、人間の幸福が遺伝的なものであるというのはここ数年あちこちで繰り返し主張されている。

2020年は随分と不穏な年となり、色々な対立があちこちで起こっている。誰が誰のどんな尺度の幸福のために闘っているのかについてより慎重になるべきではないだろうか。

ステレオタイプ

自信と情報量

They are opinionated and clear, which is exactly what television producers love to see on programs. Two hedgehogs on different sides of an issue, each attacking the idiotic ideas of the adversary, make for a good show.

Kahneman, Daniel. Thinking, Fast and Slow (p. 220). Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Kindle Edition.

The story of a child dying because an algorithm made a mistake is more poignant than the story of the same tragedy occurring as a result of human error, and the difference in emotional intensity is readily translated into a moral preference.

Kahneman, Daniel. Thinking, Fast and Slow (p. 229). Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Kindle Edition.

## 意思決定

In the presence of sunk costs, the manager’s incentives are misaligned with the objectives of the firm and its shareholders, a familiar type of what is known as the agency problem. Boards of directors are well aware of these conflicts and often replace a CEO who is encumbered by prior decisions and reluctant to cut losses. The members of the board do not necessarily believe that the new CEO is more competent than the one she replaces. They do know that she does not carry the same mental accounts and is therefore better able to ignore the sunk costs of past investments in evaluating current opportunities. The sunk-cost fallacy keeps people for too long

story: people expect to have stronger emotional reactions (including regret) to an outcome that is produced by action than to the same outcome when it is produced by inaction.

Kahneman, Daniel. Thinking, Fast and Slow (p. 348). Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Kindle Edition.

One treatment fits the normal standard of care; another is unusual. The physician has some reason to believe that the unconventional treatment improves the patient’s chances, but the evidence is inconclusive. The physician who prescribes the unusual treatment faces a substantial risk of regret, blame, and perhaps litigation. In hindsight, it will be easier to imagine the normal choice; the abnormal choice will be easy to undo. True, a good outcome will contribute to the reputation of the physician who dared, but the potential benefit is smaller than the potential cost because success is generally a more normal outcome than is failure.

Because adherence to standard operating procedures is difficult to second-guess, decision makers who expect to have their decisions scrutinized with hindsight are driven to bureaucratic solutions—and to an extreme reluctance to take risks.

him.” In contrast, Meehl and other proponents of algorithms have argued strongly that it is unethical to rely on intuitive judgments for important decisions if an algorithm is available that will make fewer mistakes. Their rational argument is compelling, but it runs against a stubborn psychological reality: for most people, the cause of a mistake matters. The story of a child dying because an algorithm made a mistake is more poignant than the story of the same tragedy occurring as a result of human error, and the difference in emotional intensity is readily translated into a moral preference.

## 自信

subjective confidence is determined by the coherence of the story one has constructed, not by the quality and amount of the information that supports it.

Kahneman, Daniel. Thinking, Fast and Slow (p. 264). Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Kindle Edition.

The standard practice of open discussion gives too much weight to the opinions of those who speak early and assertively, causing others to line up behind them.
