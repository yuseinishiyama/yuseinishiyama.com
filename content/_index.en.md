## About me

I'm Yusei Nishiyama, a software engineer and music enthusiast. I majored in philosophy and aesthetics but the beauty of programming languages led me to become a programmer. I worked as an iOS engineer for around 8 years but then my interests have shifted and I'm currently a SRE (Site Reliablity Engineer) at SoundCloud.
